2. **Validate consistency** - Ensure all documents are consistent and complete
3. **Generate code** - Create production-ready code following all specifications
4. **Structure properly** - Organize code with proper folder structure and conventions
5. **Add documentation** - Include inline comments and README files
6. **Consider scalability** - Implement with future growth in mind
7. **Security first** - Follow security best practices throughout
8. **Testing ready** - Structure code to be testable with unit, integration, and E2E tests

**Key constraints:**
- Follow the exact architecture described in architecture.md
- Implement all API endpoints in api-spec
- Include all database tables from data-model
- Satisfy all requirements in PRD.md
