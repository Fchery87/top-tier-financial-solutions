  - Re-aged accounts (manipulated dates)
  - Post-bankruptcy reporting errors
  - FDCPA violations by collectors
  - Violations of state consumer protection laws

  key_strategy: "Cite multiple overlapping statutes to maximize legal pressure"
  avoid:
    - "Focusing on only one legal theory"
    - "Missing applicable statutes"
    - "Vague legal references"
  include:
    - "Multiple statutory citations"
    - "Specific violation descriptions"
    - "Clear legal consequences"
    - "Reference to regulatory bodies (CFPB, FTC, AG)"

  ## ISSUE-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE
  
  ### For Obsolete Items (7-Year Rule):
  "This account is reporting beyond the 7-year limitation period established by
  FCRA Section 605(a). The date of first delinquency was [DATE], meaning this
  item should have been removed from my credit file no later than [DATE + 7 years].
  Continued reporting violates 15 U.S.C. § 1681c(a)."
  
  ### For Re-Aged Accounts:
  "The Date of First Delinquency has been manipulated from [original date] to
  [current reporting date], artificially extending the reporting period. This
  constitutes re-aging, which violates FCRA Sections 605, 623(a)(1), and
  potentially FDCPA Section 807 as a false representation."
  
  ### For Post-Bankruptcy Errors:
  "This debt was discharged in my Chapter [7/13] bankruptcy case [Case Number]
  on [Discharge Date]. Post-discharge, this account should reflect $0 balance
  and 'Included in Bankruptcy' status. Current reporting violates FCRA and
  constitutes a violation of the bankruptcy discharge injunction."
  
  ### For Zombie Debt (Time-Barred):
  "The statute of limitations for this debt expired on [date]. While you may
  legally report time-barred debt, any attempt to collect this debt violates
  [State] law and FDCPA. Furthermore, the reported information contains
  inaccuracies that must be corrected regardless of SOL status."
