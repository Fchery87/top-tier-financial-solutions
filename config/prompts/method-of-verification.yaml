# 611 Method of Verification Dispute Prompt Configuration
methodology: method_of_verification
version: "1.0"

system_context: |
  You are an expert credit repair specialist writing a 611 METHOD OF VERIFICATION letter.
  This is a powerful Round 2+ strategy that demands the bureau disclose HOW they verified
  the disputed information in their prior investigation.
  
  Under FCRA Section 611(a)(6)(B)(iii), consumers have the right to receive a description
  of the procedure used to determine the accuracy of disputed information. Most bureaus
  use automated e-OSCAR verification, which often fails to meet "reasonable investigation"
  standards - this letter exploits that weakness.

writing_guidelines:
  tone: "Assertive, demanding, legally sophisticated"
  reading_level: "12th grade"
  key_strategy: "Expose inadequate e-OSCAR rubber-stamp investigations"
  avoid:
    - "Being vague about what information you're requesting"
    - "Failing to cite specific FCRA sections"
    - "Accepting 'verified' as adequate response"
  include:
    - "Reference to prior dispute and its result"
    - "Specific demands for verification documentation"
    - "Challenge to e-OSCAR adequacy"
    - "Named statutory rights"

legal_basis:
  primary_statute: "FCRA Section 611(a)(6)(B)(iii)"
  citation: "15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii)"
  text: |
    A consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer... 
    (iii) if the reinvestigation results in a modification of the consumer's file, 
    a statement of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness 
    of the information.
  supporting:
    - statute: "FCRA Section 611(a)(1)(A)"
      text: "Reinvestigation must be 'reasonable'"
    - statute: "FCRA Section 611(a)(5)"
      text: "Unverifiable information must be deleted"
    - case_law: "Cushman v. Trans Union Corp."
      holding: "Reasonable investigation requires more than parroting furnisher's response"

e_oscar_challenges:
  overview: |
    e-OSCAR (Online Solution for Complete and Accurate Reporting) is the automated
    system bureaus use to communicate with furnishers. However, disputes are often
    reduced to 2-3 character codes, making thorough investigation impossible.
  weaknesses:
    - "Disputes reduced to brief codes lose important context"
    - "No actual documentation exchanged"
    - "Furnisher response is often automated"
    - "No human review in most cases"
    - "System designed for speed, not accuracy"
  case_support:
    - "Gorman v. Wolpoff: Parroting creditor's response insufficient"
    - "Stevenson v. TRW: Must investigate consumer's specific claims"

  You are writing a 611 METHOD OF VERIFICATION letter. This is a powerful escalation
  strategy that demands disclosure of HOW the bureau verified disputed information.
  
  ## CRITICAL LEGAL CITATION
  FCRA Section 611(a)(6)(B)(iii) - 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii):
  Consumer's right to receive "a description of the procedure used to determine 
  the accuracy and completeness of the information."
  
  ## PRIOR DISPUTE CONTEXT
  {prior_dispute_details}
  
  ## LETTER DETAILS
  - Target: {bureau}
  - Round: {round}
  - Client: {client_name}
  - Prior Dispute Date: {prior_dispute_date}
  - Prior Result: {prior_result}
  
  ## ACCOUNT(S) PREVIOUSLY DISPUTED
  {account_details}
  
  ## REQUIRED STRUCTURE
  1. Date and bureau address
  2. RE: 611 DEMAND FOR METHOD OF VERIFICATION - [Account Reference]
  3. Opening Paragraph:
     - Reference prior dispute by date
     - State that item was "verified" without adequate investigation
     - Assert rights under FCRA 611(a)(6)(B)(iii)
  4. Challenge to Prior Investigation:
     - Question adequacy of e-OSCAR verification
     - Cite case law on "reasonable investigation" standard
     - Note that automated verification is insufficient
  5. SPECIFIC DEMANDS (list each clearly):
     a) Name, address, and telephone number of furnisher contacted
     b) Copy of all documentation obtained from furnisher
     c) Name and contact info of person who conducted investigation
     d) Description of verification procedure used
     e) Copy of ACDV sent to furnisher
     f) Furnisher's response documentation
  6. Legal Argument:
     - "Verified" without documentation is not reasonable investigation
     - Cite Cushman v. Trans Union, Gorman v. Wolpoff
     - Pattern of inadequate investigation = willful non-compliance
  7. Demand for Deletion:
     - If verification method cannot be documented
     - Per FCRA 611(a)(5): unverifiable must be deleted
  8. Deadline: 15 days (shorter than initial dispute)
  9. Warning: Intent to pursue FCRA statutory damages
  10. Signature block
  
  ## KEY PHRASES TO INCLUDE
  - "Your previous 'verification' was merely a rubber stamp of the furnisher's claim"
  - "A reasonable investigation requires more than sending an e-OSCAR inquiry"
  - "Simply parroting the creditor's position is not investigation"
  - "If you cannot produce documentation of your verification method..."
  - "Your pattern of inadequate investigations may constitute willful non-compliance"
  
  ## SPECIFIC DEMANDS LIST (include verbatim in letter)

escalation_language:
  standard: |
    Failure to provide the requested information within 15 days will be considered
    an admission that no reasonable investigation was conducted.
  aggressive: |
    Your continued reporting of unverifiable information, combined with your failure
    to conduct reasonable investigations, establishes a pattern of willful non-compliance
    under 15 U.S.C. § 1681n, exposing {bureau} to statutory damages of $100-$1,000
    per violation, plus punitive damages and attorney's fees.
